        <h1>What Factors Affect Human Development?</h1>

            Human Development Index, or HDI for short, is a metric created by the United Nations to assess the progress of nations around the world. Factors that affect a country's HDI include health, education, economic prosperity and quality of life. HDI is determined on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 is a "perfect" level of development. This metric allows the UN to compare countries with similar economic backgrounds, and asses how and why they can have varying qualities of life.

                An important metric used to determine a nation's economic prosperity is Gross National Income per Capita. This metric is calculated by dividing the total income of a nation by its population. This metric is a useful indicators of a nation's economic situation, as the income of an individual can determine one's ability to provide themselves a high quality of living, and can also reflect a nation's ability to invest in facilities and resources to improve the overall quality of life of its population.
                <br><br>
                It is important to note that this metric does not tell the story of a nation's economics. A major factor that can affect the GNI/capita of a country is the average age, as countries with a higher share of its population at a reasonable working age will skew the average income upwards, and vice versa. On top of this, governments may implement policies that encourage those with higher incomes to reside there. For example, Liechtenstein has an extremely high GNI/capita compared to every other country due to the nation's low tax rates, attracting those with extremely high incomes.
                <br><br>
                As seen in the plot to the left, there appears to be a logarithmic relationship between a nation's Gross National Income per capita and its Human Development Index. This is likely due to the fact that economic prosperity allows for nations to provide its population with neccessities such as healthcare, education and effective shelter. However, once a nation's average income reaches a certain threshold, where these needs are able to be met, other things that are able to be afforded to its citizens may be considered as luxuries, and therefore don't greatly affect its level of development.

        <h2>How does Inequality Affect Development?</h2>
    </div>

            <p class="cont">
                The Gender Inequality Index is a measurement of how different the quality of lives are for men and women living in the same country. An index of 0 means that women and men have the exact same quality of life, while an index of 1 means that one gender lives with the worst possible conditions that determine the Human Development Index. Despite this relationship, it should be understood that gender inequality is not a factor considered by the Human Development Index.
                <br><br>
                Shown by graphing the Human Development Index against the Gender Inequality Index, there is a largely linear relationship between the two metrics, showing that for a nation to fully realise its ability to develop, it must be able to offer the same opportunities and neccessities to everyone, regardless of gender. There are a few outliers to this trend, the main three of which being Tonga, Papua New Guinea and Yemen. This could possibly be due to the GII having a less broad consideration than HDI. A likely possibility is that these three nations may have great overall healthcare and education levels for all genders, but may be lacking in areas such as labour participation or reproductive health.
                <br><br>
                However, the reason that a lower GII correlates with a high HDI is due to the metrics used to calculate GII. The three major factors affecting GII are reproductive health, professional (labour and political) participation and education. When a nation is able to perform well in these categories, it means that they will generally have higher levels of education, healthcare and economic prosperity, due to the higher participation rates, in comparison to nations where only one gender is likely to be educated or be in the workforce.

            It is important to note that the Human Development Index, while aiming to equitably determine the quality of life of every nation in the world, is not a catch-all metric to compare two nations, as not every nation has the same definition of devlelopment, and therefore may have different political goals.
